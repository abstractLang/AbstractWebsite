Hello! \
I'm Camila, a young developer that want do do something cool.
In this post, i will try to explain this project and my plans
to it.

<!-- truncate -->

(sry bad english and bad writing, i'm not good with texts and english is not my first lang :3)

There's a lot of times that i tried to do my own language interpreters and compilers, but nothing so good.
In my early days as a little dumb programmer girl, i don't even knew what a lexer is! So in this point, i
started to study about languages, parsers, etc.

With my programation history, i learned a really huge diversity of programming lanugages. Javascript, Typescript,
Python, C, C++, Java, C#, Zig and go on. 

With all that knowledge, i wanted to back to language development and try, with my current knowledge, do my own
compiler again.

So here am i, trying to combine all the better features of the market with a simple yet powerful syntax.

Yeah, i know. I really don't have so much to say about me and the project, it's just... a experiment anyways.

The first development version of the compiler is already in github (to still be compiled). If you want, give a try
in my project. It still can't build a fully executeable app but maybe, with time, i can achive this.

Thanks for read!
