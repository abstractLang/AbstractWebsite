Since last blog I decided to rework on the entire compile to improve
development and performance using the knowledge that i obtained from
the last one.

<!-- truncate -->

After created a new repository, I prefered follow a more simple design
for the compiler archtecture. To avoid extending too much about the
technicall things of it, I will just sumarise that it made the development
surprisingly fast and I will probably release a useable bet version soon.
