# Introduction

The Abstract Programming Language is a general-purpoise system programming language
made to be easy to learn, read, write and share. \
The Abstract Development Environment is planned to be  pretty rich, including systems
for build, debugging, unit testing and modularity.

## Abstract's Phylosophy

The philosophy of a language is one of the most important points of it development.
It contains all the concepts that allow the and justifies it existence.

Abstract uses as it foundation five concepts:
> Controll, Readability, Security and Portability

### Controll

Abstract is made to be a high-level language that allows the user to acess the
lower levels possible by the targeting platform. it is made by features like:

- Inline assembly;
- Explicit compatibility with other languages and libraries;
- Compialtion-time process, pre and post processors, modules and plugins;

### Readability

Abstract is made to allow the user to understand easily the code that is being
writen, being by themself or other developers.
Scope closures and desigin patterns helps the developers to comunicate just by
reading each other codebases, making the code process more understandable and
fast.

### Security

Even allowing the user to go in the most deeper levels of the machine, the abstract
language also cares about security. Memory leaks, null pointers and buffer overflows
are well-handled by the language to ensure a program without undesired behaviors.

### Portability

The Abstract environment architecture have powerfull building, compiling and linking
systems that allows codebases and libraries that can be compiled to a extensive collection
of digital devices without any headache.
