# Functions

Functions are simple ways to define subroutines or common and repetitive tasks.

The basic concept of a function is a block of code that can maybe accept arguments and can maybe
return data.
This block can easily be called by other functions in any moment or order.

A example of function declaration and call in abstract is
```abs
func void foo() {
    Std.Console.log("foo called!")
}

foo()
```
```text title="Console Output"
foo called!
```

A function can be called by it reference followed by a opening and closing parenthesis `()` as follows:
```abs
FunctionReference()
```

It the function ask for arguments, the values should be declarated, in order, inside the parenthesis
```abs
@public @static()
func void foo(i32 a, i8 b, i128 c) { ... }

const i32 myInt = 100
const myByte = 255
const i128 myLonger = 999999999999999999999999

# correct call!
foo(myInt, myByte, myLonger) 

# /!\ Compilation error!
# There's no function 'foo' with this parameter type order!
foo(myByte, myInt, myLonger)

# /!\ Compilation error!
# There's no function 'foo' that accepts only a byte!
foo(myByte)
```

## Function Overloading

Two or more functions can have the same identifier if they have different types.
When a function is declarated with the same name, but with a diferent tipe, it's called overload.

:::info[Good Practice]
The Abstract Language emphasizes the language readability and understanding over abstraction.
As a good practice, make sure to only use function overloading when the result will be the same
for the same equivalent values. In some cases could be a good practice overload a function to ommit
a repetitive or optional value.

<summary>Examples</summary>

```abs title="Good Practice"
# Different results are named diferently

func void writeText(string value) {
    Std.Console.log("My string is: " + value)
}
func void writeText([]char value) {
    Std.Console.log("My string is: " + string.join(value))
}
func void writeNumber(i32 value) {
    Std.Console.log("My number is: " + value)
}
```

```abs title="Bad Practice"
# Different results with the same name can result in a
# harder understanding of the code

func void writeText(string value) {
    Std.Console.log("My string is:" + value)
}
func void writeText([]char value) {
    Std.Console.log("My string is:" + string.join(value))
}
func void writeText(i32 value) {
    Std.Console.log("My number is:" + value)
}
```
