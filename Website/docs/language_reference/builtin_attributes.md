# Built-in Attributes

:::info[Under Construction]
:::

Attributes are the things with the `@` prefix
They do uhhh things with the uhhhh member that follows their declaration (during uhhhh compiling mainly)
They can accept parameters too

some cool random attributes from my test code and Std lib:
```
@public
@static
@final

@valueOnly
@referenceOnly
@abstract

@virtual

@get(string)
@set(string)
@IndexerGet
@IndexerSet

@ImplicitConvert
@overrideOperator(string)

@defineGlobal(.. string)
```
