# Packet
:::info[Under Construction]
:::

Packets are more literal versions of data structures. While a `struct` can, most time, expend more
data that expected with some support implicit data added to it, packets are made to be a exact 1:1
map of it implementation to memory.

Packets are designed to not just have total precision on it size in memory as too allow the user to
have full controll of all the bits stored on it.
